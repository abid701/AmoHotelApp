- An application for hotel reception, developed using Spring Boot, in collaboration with Milad Akbari.

## Database Setup

To run this project, you will need to set up the MySQL database using the provided files in the AmoHotelApp_database
directory.

### Steps:
If you already have MySQL Workbench set up and know how to use it, you can skip the first step.

1. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your local MySQL server. (If you don't have MySQL Workbench set up, you can find tutorials on YouTube to guide you through installing MySQL Server and Workbench. Here's a link to a video that shows you how to do it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxdSUGBs0gM
While setting up MySQL Workbench, ensure that you set the username and password to 'root'.

2. Set Up MySQL Connection:
   - If you have MySQL Workbench installed, add a new MySQL connection.
   - Set the username and password to 'root'.

3. Import the Database Dump Files:

  - Import the dump files into MySQL Workbench.
  - Ensure the database folder(schema) you import the files into is named 'amo_db'.
  - If you’re unsure how to import dump files, here’s a link to a tutorial on how to do it.
